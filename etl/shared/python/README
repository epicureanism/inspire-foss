This is the sETL framework. The 's' stands for simple or spatial ETL.

sETL originated in the inspire-foss project (www.inspire-foss.org)
and was created by Just van den Broecke.

This framework is used for INSPIRE and other complex GML-related ETL.

Simple: just specify a config file with the main chain of ETL steps.
