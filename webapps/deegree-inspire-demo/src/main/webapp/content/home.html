        <h2>How to use this demo</h2>

        <p>
            This demo provides deegree 3 WFS and WMS services. The deegree 3 WFS is configured to
            serve <b>all</b> INSPIRE Annex I schemas. Feel free to try to insert
            any valid INSPIRE feature collection using a WFS transaction (WFS-T) and query it afterwards using the
            <a href="#" onclick="Pages.showPage('client')">Client</a>.
            The <a href="#" onclick="Pages.showMap()">Map</a> shows the same INSPIRE data as WMS layers.
            For the following INSPIRE Data Themes, some features are already
            inserted and have corresponding layers in the deegree 3 WMS:
