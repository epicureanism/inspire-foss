<div class="gv-html-panel-body">
<p>This viewer renders Dutch INSPIRE data as WMS layers using Deegree3 WMS with SLD. The current themes supported are
Cadastral Parcels (CP) and Addresses (AD). Data is present for selected parts
    of The Netherlands.

</p>
    <br/>
    <p>
           To view AD, please  <a href="#" onclick="GeoViewer.main.getMainPanel().setMapContext('addresses')">click here (zooms to Addresses)</a>.
    </p>
<br/>
    <p>The projection of this map is ETRS89 (EPSG:4258) as required for INSPIRE. This projection is similar to WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
        hence The Netherlands looks "broader" than in the usual projections.

    </p>
