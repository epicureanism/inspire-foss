20.august.2011 - Just van den Broecke

This directory contains all that is needed to run INSPIRE WFS/WMS services with
the deegree framework (www.deegree.org).

Starting with the 3.1 branch of deegree development the service web app and its configuration
(called "workspaces") have been modularized. By default the service webapp (.war)
does not have a configuration embedded but looks by default in the HOME directory $HOME/.deegree
for workspaces.

Below there are thus 2 subdirs:
- webapp - contains for now instructions how to download and run the deegree 3.1+ .war file
- workspace - the workspace of the inspire-foss deegree server, adapt for your local situation
