This directory contains ETL for the ESDIN European Topography (Large Scale) known as ExM Large Scale.

As ExM currently (14.dec.2010) mainly extends INSPIRE Annex I themes (AU, CP, GN, HY, TN) by
inheritance without adding extra elements/attrs the transformation is
done using transformed GML data from these Annex I (AU, CP, GN, HY, TN),
mainly changing NameSpaces and Inspire Ids.

In the longer term and as ESDIN will add more to the ExM schemas,
a more elegant solution should be in place.
