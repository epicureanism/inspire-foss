This directory contains a basic validator tool. It validates
GML files against their XSDs (Schema definitions), transferring XSDs
over the network where required.

For a full validation more is required and
we may add stuff like Schematron here.

Online alternative: see http://www.validome.org/xml/validate very useful.
