To test and validate INSPIRE Download (WFS) and View (WMS) services the EU-sponsored EuroGeoGraphics ESDIN
project (www.esdin.eu) has developed test-tools that can be configured to run against your services. The
ESDIN test-tools have been built using proven test frameworks like SoapUI, LoadUI and JUnit.
Lead developer was Interactive Instruments supported by other companies like lat-lon.

The ESDIN test-tools are publicly available under the BSD license and can be downloaded from

http://www.esdin.eu/project/summary-esdin-project-public-deliverables#test
(See item 38, in particular the latest link to the Test Components
now: http://services.interactive-instruments.de/download/ETF-1.1.zip)

The ESDIN project has been finalized. The intended follow-up project is the European Location Framework (ELF).
Within ELF the test-tools will be further developed and possibly made available as Free and Open Source
to developers. Stay tuned.
