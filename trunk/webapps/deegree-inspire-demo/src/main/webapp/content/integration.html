        <p>You may integrate local/national geodata as part of an ETL process. The ETL "Load" step may be performed
        as follows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Insert INSPIRE data via WFS-T (see above)</li>
            <li>Insert INSPIRE data directly in a database (e.g. PostGIS)</li>
            <li>Insert INSPIRE data via custom deegree Feature Store Client</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
