<div class="gv-html-panel-body">
<p>This viewer renders Dutch INSPIRE data as WMS layers. The current themes supported are
Cadastral Parcels (CP) and Addresses (AD). Data is present for selected parts
    of The Netherlands : for CP the area of South Limburg (near Maastricht) and for AD
    those towns that had address-data from the basic adminstration (BAG) available.
    Currently there are no areas that have both CP and AD available.

</p>
    <br/>
    <p>
           To view AD, please  <a href="#" onclick="GeoViewer.main.getMainPanel().setMapContext('tilburg')">click here (zooms to Tilburg)</a>.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
           To view CP, please <a href="#" onclick="GeoViewer.main.getMainPanel().setMapContext('limburg')">click here (zooms to South Limburg)</a>.
    </p>

    <p>The projection of this map is ETRS89 (EPSG:4258) as required for INSPIRE. This projection is similar to WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
        hence The Netherlands looks "broader" than in the usual projections.
