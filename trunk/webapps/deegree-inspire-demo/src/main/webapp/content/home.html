    <p>
        This is a demonstration of an INSPIRE implementation based on
        <a href="http://wiki.deegree.org/deegreeWiki/deegree3">deegree 3 OGC web services</a>.
        It showcases INSPIRE Download and View Services for the Annex I Data Themes.

    <div class="gv-page-title">What can you do with this demo?</div>
    <div class="gv-page-text">
    This demo provides deegree 3 WFS and WMS services. The deegree 3 WFS is configured to serve <b>all</b> INSPIRE Annex I schemas, feel free to try to insert
    any valid INSPIRE feature collection using a WFS transaction and query it afterwards using the
        <a href="#" onclick="Pages.showPage('client')">Client</a>.
        For the following INSPIRE Data Themes, some features are already
    inserted and have corresponding layers in the deegree 3 WMS:
    <ul>
      <li>Address</li>
      <li>CadastralParcels</li>
    </ul>
