#summary explore and extend inspire-foss components with the InspireFossBox virtual appliance

= Introduction =

The main goal of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience with software components of the [http://inspire-foss.org inspire-foss project]. These components include: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), web services for WFS and WMS, plus visualisation through a web client. You can experience how these components work together in order to support the entire data delivery chain from raw national data to harmonized INSPIRE data and network services.

In order to quickly get up and running, a so-called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_appliance Virtual Appliance] has been developed that contains a complete [http://www.ubuntu.com Ubuntu Linux] environment for running inspire-foss components. In addition this Appliance, named `InspireFossBox`, runs the [http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ IntelliJ IDEA] Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using an Open Source license in order to visualize code and data and moreover execute the ETL and to run webservices for WFS and WMS. The only other tool you will need to run within `InspireFossBox` is the pre-installed [http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/ Firefox web browser].

= Getting Prepared =
In order to proceed you should have setup and run
the `InspireFossBox` virtual appliance. This is described in [InspireFossBoxSetup].

If all is well and the `InspireFossBox` appliance is tarted you should see the screen below.

= The Tools =
You will only need two tools to run all exercises in the workshop:

  # [http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ IntelliJ IDEA] 
  # the Firefox webbrowser

[http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ IntelliJ IDEA] is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has been setup for the inspire-foss project with lots of shortcut commands (via [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant]) to run ETL, start the [http://deegree.org deegree server] etc. Note: since we use/develop Open Source, IntelliJ bears a free of charge license. Note that you are only allowed to develop Open Source with this license. Since IntelliJ is a fantastic product it is worthwhile to buy a license anyway.

You start the tools as indicated below.


Click on the [http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ IntelliJ IDEA] icon to start (takes a while).
 


= The Works =
This is a `WorkShop` so this is where the real work starts.
