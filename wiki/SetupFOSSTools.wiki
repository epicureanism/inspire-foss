#summary How to setup various tools needed to run inspire-foss software

= Introduction =

The software from the inspire-foss project does not consist of an executable program. Rather there are various scripts and configurations that use a variety of Free and Open Source Software tools and components. This section lists the various tools required, with some guidance how to set things up. This setup has been tested/performed on Unix-like systems like Mac OSX and Ubuntu Linux. All tools are also available for the Windows OS-family (XP, 7 etc).
