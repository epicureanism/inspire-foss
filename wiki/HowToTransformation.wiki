#summary a guide to setting up Transformation and ETL

= Introduction =

This `HowTo` describes how to transform your local national data 
to INSPIRE harmonized data and how to embed this transformation in a
complete [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)] chain.
This will be illustrated using
some of the existing transformation resources present within the project.
In the remainder of this document the term "ETL" will be used.

= Background Reading =
In order to grasp the steps that follow in upcoming sections we advise to
first read about the concepts and design underpinning the ETL.

The main document (HTML and PDF) to start with is [http://inspire.kademo.nl/doc]. Although this document has references to data  specific to the
[http://www.kadaster.nl The Dutch Kadaster] it has general applicability. In particular
the sections about [http://inspire.kademo.nl/doc/concept.html Concepts] and
[http://inspire.kademo.nl/doc/design-etl.html ETL Design] should provide the basic
information on the how and why of the ETL. This document also provides some
specific information on the [http://inspire.kademo.nl/doc/implementation.html ETL Implementation]
where actual code is even directly included within the document.

All code related to ETL resides in the Subversion repository. All code can be browsed
online via https://code.google.com/p/inspire-foss/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fetl .

Further background knowledge that helps in understanding the ETL implementation deals with the technologies
that are used:

  * [http://gdal.org GDAL/OGR] core format and projection transformation. Although GDAL/OGR is
    an entire suite of libraries/tools, only a single command-line tool is used: [http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html ogr2ogr].
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT XSLT] is used for model/schema transformation. To about XSLT, the best source
    to start is [http://www.w3schools.com/xsl the XSLT tutorial at W3Schools.com].
