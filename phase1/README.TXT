THIS IS OLD STUFF KEPT HERE FOR REFERENCE, USE THE OTHER DIRS UNDER TRUNK

Primary contact: Just van den Broecke - just@justobjects.nl

This is the top directory for phase1 of the project "inspire-foss". This phase was completed
and is put here for reference. It uses deegree version 2 (now deegree v3 is used) and
a relational DB model to which national source data is transformed (ETL). Also the ETL and db
are not relevant.



The directories below contain the following:

- /db tools and SQL for the PostGIS INSPIRE database
- /ETL Extract Transfer Load, countr/NMA-specific transformation tools from national data to the INSPIRE DB
- /webapps - web applications (mainly WFS) for serving INSPIRE-compliant Theme data
- /doc - all documentation in Sphinx, see also http://inspire.kademo.nl
