How this document was made
**************************

This document has been written with an Open Source documentation
package called `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_. Sphinx is not a wordprocessor or
editor but a simple `text-based markup language <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ together with tools to generate
documents in a multitude of formats like, HTML, Latex and PDF.

Sphinx is becoming increasingly popular, in particular within Open Source Geospatial communities,
like `GeoServer <http://geoserver.org>`_ and  `OpenLayers <http://docs.openlayers.org>`_.
The entire `GeoExt website <http://geoext.org>`_  is written and generated using Sphinx.

In addition
Sphinx uses the `Jinja <http://jinja.pocoo.org>`_ templating engine for its HTML
templates. The templates provide for the generation of this website using Kadaster styles.

In our setup of Sphinx we maintain all source documents within our Kademo `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`_
repository (SVN). So basically we treat documentation sources in a similar way as software sources.
Both HTML and PDF output formats are generated (using ``Make`` and `Apache Ant <http://ant.apache.org>`_)
and synced to the `kademo.nl <http://kademo.nl>`_ website.
PDF output is generated by generating LateX and subsequently converting LateX to PDF
using ``pdflatex`` from the `TeX Live <http://www.tug.org/>`_  package. For convenience the `PDF version <pdf/kad-inspire-foss.pdf>`_ of this
entire document is hyperlinked at the top of this page.
