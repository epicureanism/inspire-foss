Conclusions
***********

This chapter contains conclusions and suggestions for further development. Our conclusions are
as follows:

* Open Source works ! We have been able to provide a first WFS within less than 50 working hours. Within EURADIN and ESDIN we were the first partner supplying a fully INSPIRE-conformant WFS.
* Combined Transformation works !

Future Work
===========

* port implementation to deegree v3 (started, see `deegree INSPIRE demo <http://inspire.kademo.nl/deegree-inspire-demo/>`_)
* implement cross-theme relationships, for example an address can refer to a cadastral parcel
* implement WFS with GeoServer v2 Community Schemas
* trigger-based ETL: keep INSPIRE database in sync with Kadaster data source database through a trigger process
