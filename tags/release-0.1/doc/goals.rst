Goals
*****

This chapter outlines the main goals we had for this project. The main drivers are commitments of The Dutch Kadaster
as a partner within  `EURADIN WP7 <http://www.euradin.eu>`_ and
`ESDIN WP11 <http://www.esdin.eu>`_. Since requirements from these consortia were overlapping,
a single, integrated software approach was used.

Specific goals/requirements are:

* ESDIN WP11: provide a WFS with at least one Annex I INSPIRE theme. We have chosen to use the theme Cadastral Parcels (CP).
* EURADIN WP7: provide a WFS with the Annex I INSPIRE theme Addresses (AD).
* Open Source: prove that (geospatial) Free and Open Source provides viable components for the workflow from local/national data sets to a WFS with INSPIRE-conformant application/theme data.
* provide a software prototype that can be the starting point for an Open Source INSPIRE Data approach such as defined in [OSGeo-INSPIRE]_ and [INSPIRE-FOSS-SDI]_.

Specific goals/requirements currently under development are:

* EURADIN WP7: provide a custom SOAP-based Web service for a Gazetteer.
* ESDIN WP11: provide View services for at least one Annex one theme.
* Additional Annex I themes such as GeoNames (GN)
